## Online Banking Management System

#### *About the system*
This online banking management system allows users to perform
various tasks related to their banking accounts and transactions
without visiting the branches. Through the system, the users can
create a checking and/or saving account and set a password to log in.
After creating the account, users can deposit & withdraw money,
view their balance, and transfer money between existing accounts.
The saving account has several interest rates (simple or compound)
available depending on their status, and the users can set a savings goal
within a specified time frame. The system calculates how much they need
to save each month to reach that goal and provides a brief recommendation for the users.

#### *Who will use it?*
Anyone can create an account and access the system remotely.

#### *Why this project?*
As a finance student, I wanted to work on a project that is related
to finance, and this banking system project allows me to apply my knowledge.
Also, by creating the system myself, I can cultivate a deeper
understanding of the banking system.
